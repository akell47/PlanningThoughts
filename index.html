    <h3>This Morning's Thought</h3>
    <h5>August 9, 2016 : 9:43 AM</h5>
    <p>
      I woke up this morning and thought "Man, I want a meatball!".  It was a simple thought, without much need for other more complex thoughts, like "why does life exist?"  It's been nice having such a simple morning, with such a simple thought.  But I still don't have a meatball.
