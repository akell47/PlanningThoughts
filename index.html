    <h1>My Thoughts</h1>
      <h3>This Morning's Thought</h3>
        <h5>August 9, 2016 : 9:43 AM</h5>
      <p>
        I woke up this morning and thought "Man, I want a meatball!".  It was a simple thought, without much need for other more complex thoughts, like "why does life exist?"  It's been nice having such a simple morning, with such a simple thought.  But I still don't have a meatball.

    <h3>Kid friendly coffee shops</h2>
      <h5>August 11, 2016 : 12:05 AM</h5>
      <p>
        Why are there not more kid friendly coffee shops? <br>
        Parents love and need coffee. <br>

        Imagine sipping on a delicious cappuchino whike the little one grabs some toys and you don't have to be paranoid about bringing your kid there because you know they are welcome to be there and you can put your mind at ease and feel that caffine prepare you for a thousand questions, requests, and activities.<br>
        Seriously, this is a huge untapped market. There's some serious <font color="green"> green </font> to be made here!
