If a councilperson paid an architecture company to do a study and create plans to get rid of all the marta stops in the city of Dunwoody or wanted to get rid all the bike lanes on the roads I would like to think that these ideas would not gain traction.  <br>
<br>
This is how I feel about this desire to get rid of these apartment complexes.  I don’t understand what kind of world we are living it to think its ok to displace and disrupt thousands of people’s lives at the sake of beautification. <br>
<br>
This is not something I feel proud of I don’t understand what good is this for. <br>
<br>
Although yes in law what happens to the property is decision of the land OWNER not the occupants. However a city should have responsibility to understand the implications of the human consequences of promoting and advertising displacement of roughly 3,000 people and families. <br>
<br>
In principle yes the land owner has rights to the land but as civil humans we have responsibility not to activly bring hardships to families. <br>
Bringing hardships to families is exactly what this plan from TSW is. The city hired TSW to create a redevelopment sample plan that consists of highly unaffordable development plan of townhomes and more luxury apartments.
<br><br>
Families need stability to thrive.
These are your constituents. How can we be of service to the residents not push them around. <br>
What do the residents want? What kind of community do they want to live in. They have opinions about creating and living in Dunwoody too!
